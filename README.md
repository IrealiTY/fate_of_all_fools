# Fate of All Fools
["Fate of All Fools"](http://destinydb.com/item/3490486524/fate-of-all-fools)?

[TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)-based minor enhancements to the visual presentation of [Destiny Item Manager](https://www.destinyitemmanager.com/) for Destiny 2. You should totally use DIM, it's awesome!

# Before and After

# Reductions
* **Remove subclass icons**: I've never once switched subclasses this way. OK, maybe once to see if it worked (it does!) but never enough to warrant having this displayed at all times.

# Tweaks / Relocations
* **Consistent, subdued background throughout**: No need for the contrast between toons and vault; the grouping of items is enough.
* **Improved display of power level**: Maybe it's because I'm forty... the font for LL was too small and difficult to read. Slight increase to the font size and decrease (increase?) to the opacity to make things easier to read.
* **Power level background indicates element**: The elemental damage type tags were another visual cue that seems excessive in a screen full of gear, so I've moved them back to the background of the power level.
* **Flipped Kinetic weapon orientation**: Kinetic weapons now face the same direction as Energy and Power Weapons (bottom-left to top-right). This was so that the LL and any icons would not be on top of the weapon itself.
* **Removed yellow border for mods**: This has been replaced with a `+M` after the power level of a weapon or piece of armor. The yellow border was too much visual distraction for this small bit of information, and overwhelming to look at a vault full of yellows. It's also hard to turn off the part of my brain that thinks this is a "fully leveled item" from Destiny 1 :)
